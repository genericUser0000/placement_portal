# Placement Portal

This is a simple and small website example I have written for my seniors. It will be connecting the database to the backend server. I have started working on it today at 12.05.2019

# Goals

- [ ] Creating a simple website to show how the database is linked.
- [ ] Making sure that the code is easy to use.
- [ ] Giving it to my seniors so that they can append it to the main project.
- [ ] Then focusing on my internship.
